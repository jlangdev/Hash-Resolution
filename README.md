COP 3530 Hashing Analysis project

This project tests the collisions vs load factor of 2 different hashing functions utilizing 2 different collision resolution schemes.

Hashing functions: Key Mod Table Size & Mid Square Mod Table Size
Collision Resolution: Open Addressing & Seperate Chaining

The experiment runs with 3 different table sizes.

This results in 12 different experiements. 4 for each combination of hash/collision times 3 table sizes each.

The source code for the experiment is found in the .js file. To see the generated graphs, use the .html file, as it includes a graphing library
and generates interactive graphs for each experiment.
